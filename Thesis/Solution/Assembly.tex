\subsection{Connections}

This section will present how the different elements composing the robot are connected, first from the electrical point of view, then from a means of communication angle and finally from the different programs' interactions perspective.



%%%%%%%%%% ELECTRIC %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection{Electrical connections}

Figure \ref{electricDiagram} shows how the different electric and electronic components are interconnected.  As it can be seen, different voltage levels co-exist within the robot, so regulators are placed to ensure the components function correctly. \\

The DC motors need the highest voltage to work, and so are connected to the battery, which provides them with the 12V they need. However they have to be controlled by the Arduino, hence the need for a driver that will turn on and off the 12V rails from 5V signals.\\

The rest of the components operate at 5V, which is why the step-down converter is used to convert the battery's 12V output into the desired level. The Raspberry Pi, Arduino and servomotors are connected to this rail.\\

Finally, the Raspberry communicates with the Arduino through the former's UART pins, which operate at a 3.3V level and can be damaged by the latter's 5V level pins. To avoid this a logic level shifter is introduced, which ensures data transmission without compromising the hardware's integrity.\\

%%%%%%%%%% LOGIC %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection{Logic connections}

Figure \ref{logicDiagram} shows how the different components communicate between themselves. As it can be seen, the user controls the robot from the Android application. This implements a bidirectional communication over wifi with the Raspberry Pi, which is used to both send the Raspberry data concerning the movement of the different motors and to receive the video stream from the robot's onboard camera. The Raspberry then communicates over Serial port with the Arduino, which takes care of the data received to obey the user's commands.\\

%%%%%%%%%% SW %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection{Software connections}

Figure \ref{swDiagram} shows how the different programs interconnect the various components. It can thus be seen that the Raspberry Pi will first create a wifi network and then start to stream video through it. The android phone on the other hand will connect itself to the recently created network and will use it to emit the commands given by the user. The Raspberry will have already started the IP/UART Bridge, and will send the data received from the phone to the Arduino. Finally, the latter will execute its code to execute the orders received.\\
