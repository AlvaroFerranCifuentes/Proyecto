The Raspberry Pi carries out three main duties to ensure everything works correctly. These include creating a wireless connection, streaming images from the camera to the phone and transmitting the data received from the phone to the microcontroller.\\

 These are all placed into the \textit{/etc/rc.local} file so the system initializes them automatically each time the robot is turned on, with no need for human interaction.

\subsection{Wireless Communications}% WiFi Acces Point

The chosen means of communication between human and humanoid was wifi. This is so because it is a widely established technology, with great compatibility and in a great number of cases is already installed in the homes of users.\\

Three methods were considered: connection to an existing wifi network, creation of an Ad-Hoc connection and establishment of a wifi Access Point.
