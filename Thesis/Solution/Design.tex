Before arriving to its final form, several designs for the PD-SD were considered. Here are listed the various alternatives weighed:

\paragraph{Humanoid} The most natural form an assitive robot can take to replace a person in home chores is that of another, since homes are designed to be controlled and navigated by humans. \\

Therefore a humanoid robot was the inmediate answer: its degrees of freedom would enable it to carry out the same tasks as their human counterparts, it would have the right size to be able to handle objects placed in high furniture and it would have a form that would generate an emotional response from the user.\\

However, the humanoid has one major disadvantage, control. While two-legged robots do exist, as seen previously with Honda's ASIMO, they are very unstable and require active control algorithims to balance it. \\

To make the droid stable even when unpowered and to simplify the algorithims the legs were replaced by a wheeled base. This also had the side effect of reducing the cost, since each wheel would be driven by one motor to provide a differential drive, instead of a total of twelve motors for a pair of full human like legs, with three to simulate the hip joint, one for the knee and two more for the ankle, per leg.\\


\paragraph{Four wheels} The first wheeled base design envisaged four wheels in order to keep it stable, each with its own motor. However, the design is redundant, as a two-wheeled base with a caster at the rear end is equally stable but reduces the number of active wheels. This decreases the price, the power consumption, frees up two pins on the micro controller and reduces the length of the code, while remaining suitable to support the robot.


\paragraph{Exoskeleton} One of the first designs is shown in Figure \ref{exoskeleton}. It featured a robot with an exoskeleton and a central beam. This version granted different levels into which the various components could be placed while hiding the cables inside. \\

	\bigskip

However, it provided very little stability and a design with a more human-like skeleton was chosen.\\


\paragraph{Arm designs} The most natural configuration for the robot to grasp objects would be that of a human hand, especially taking into account that most objects are designed to be handled it.\\

However, in the final design a parallel gripper was chosen because it reduced the number of motors needed to one per gripper, while having two parallel-closing fingers capable of gripping objects of differing sizes.\\

The first CAD model of the arm is shown in Figure \ref{firstArm}. It included five motors, four directional and one to control the gripping action. The orientation of the servomotors ensured rotation in all three axes, with two degrees of freedom in the pitch angle. This is done to give the possibility of linear movement useful for lifting and lowering objects in cluttered spaces.

In Figure \ref{finalArm} the final design is shown. While it keeps the original servo orientation, the placement is modified to reduce the distance between the two leftmost motors and so reduce the torque needed to lift objects. \\
The plastic parts have also been modified to enclose the motors, which now are firmly secured in place, and to support the weight of the arm instead of relying in the screws to do so.
