\paragraph{Humanoid} ->unstable


\paragraph{Four wheels} -> more expensive, more difficult control, more power, more pins

\paragraph{Exoskeleton} -> not enough structural stability

\paragraph{One arm} -> Only one task at a time, can't carry trays

\paragraph{Arm designs} -> Pictures of different designs -> Better because of firmer grip, less torque on plastic...

endo vs exo skeleton
one vs two arms



built replicating human torso rods as bones instead of exoskeleton

5 dof (4+1) ensure redundancy and posssibility of linear movement for some detailed tasks

denavit hartenberg for arms

election of wheels vs legs -> most houses in spain are flats (find source) and so there are no stairs. for flat surfaces wheels are more stable than legs at the same number (2 + 1 caster vs at least 3-4) and so cheaper

Differential drive robot easier to control than multi dof legs  less actuators  cheaper
