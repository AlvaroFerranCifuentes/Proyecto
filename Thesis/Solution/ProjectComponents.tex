3D printers are Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machines that are capable of transforming virtual 3D models created with a Computer Aided Design (CAD) software into real-world objects.\\

Created in 1984 by Chuck Hull of 3D Systems Corp this technology was little-known to the general public and was mainly used in industries for short runs of difficult pieces.\\
In 2005 Dr. Adrian Bowyer, from the University of Bath, UK, started the RepRap project. Its goal was "to produce a pure self-replicating device not for its own sake, but rather to put in the hands of individuals anywhere on the planet, for a minimal outlay of capital, a desktop manufacturing system that would enable the individual to manufacture many of the artifacts used in everyday life" \\

Today a vast range of 3D printers co-exist, varying in size, price and materials used. \\

In this theses a RepRap Prusa Air 2 designed by Manuel Palacios is used. It is of a "fused filament fabrication additive manufacturing" type. This type of printers extrude mainly ABS or PLA plastics, and deposit new liquified material over ther previous layer, now solid, effectively building parts from the bottom up layer by layer.
