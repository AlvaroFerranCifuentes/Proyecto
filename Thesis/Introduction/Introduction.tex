\section{Scope of the project}

This project's ultimate objective is to build a robotic assistant prototype, which may be controlled by a user from their own smartphone and which will stream a video feed from its camera so the user is able to see through the robot. This prototype is built to develop the technology that can be later used in a full-scale robot capable of assisting people with disabilities.\\

In order to achieve this result, the project is divided into various objectives:
