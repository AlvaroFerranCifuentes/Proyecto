The robot's components cost is of 181.80 \euro. \\

However, this only takes into account the cost of replicating the robot, not the actual cost of developping the project. In order to get the total cost for this project the engineer's man hours cost must be included, and these can be seen in the previous appendix. \\

The total number of hours being XXXXXXXXX at an hourly rate of 8\euro, the cost of man hours is 

Therefore, the project's total cost is $181.80+$
