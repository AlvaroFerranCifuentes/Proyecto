\section{Project planning} \label{app:gantt}

This appendix breaks down the project into its different phases and their durations. The project started on 1st November 2013 and finished on the 7th October 2014, with blank periods during January, May and June, due to the examination sessions in the University.  \\

Figure \ref{Ganttresumen} summarizes the phases in a table detailing the duration of each one.

The robot's components cost is of 181.80 \euro. \\

However, this only takes into account the cost of replicating the robot, not the actual cost of developping the project. In order to get the total cost for this project the engineer's man hours cost must be included, and these can be seen in the previous appendix. \\

The total number of hours being 906 at an hourly rate of 8\euro, the cost of man hours is 906 Â· 8=7248\euro.\\

Therefore, the project's total cost is 181.80+7248=7429.80\euro.
